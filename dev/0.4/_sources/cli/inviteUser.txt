invite-user
~~~~~~~~~~~

The invite-user command generates a command that another user may use to join your organization. That member can in turn invite additional people into the organization as needed.

Syntax
++++++

The basic syntax of the invite-user command is:

``dwc invite-user <emailAddress>``

The full syntax including all optional arguments is:

``dwc <top level arguments> invite-user -h --non-admin --no-svc --verify <emailAddress>``

More information about each argument can be found under :ref:`arguments <inviteUserArguments>`.

Expected Response
+++++++++++++++++

Successful calls will result in the following response:

.. code-block:: none

   Inviting <emailAddress> to <orgId>...``
   Success! Send them:
   
   dwc accept-invitation '<orgId>' '<invitationCode>' '<emailAddress>'

where <orgId> is the organization ID of your organization, <invitationCode> is an identifier generated by the {{{cli_product}}} CLI to verify that the user has the right to join the organization, and <emailAddress> is the email address supplied in the request

Common Error States
+++++++++++++++++++

The most common error encountered with this call is that the user being invited is already registered with {{{company}}} (possibly under a different organization). In this case, the user should contact {{{company}}} at {{{support_address}}}.

.. _inviteUserArguments:

Arguments
+++++++++

The following arguments are supported for the invite-user command:

* -h
* --non-admin
* --no-svc
* --verify
* <emailAddress>

-h
&&

-h is described under :ref:`general command arguments <generalH>`.

.. _inviteUserNonAdmin:

--non-admin
&&&&&&&&&&&

This option is internal and should not be used. In the future, it may be used to create users without administrative privileges, but at this time all users of an organization are expected to be admins.

.. _inviteUserNoService:

--no-svc
&&&&&&&&

Optional. Indicates that the invited user should not be able to create services within the organization

Equivalent Options
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The following arguments are equivalent to --no-svc:

* --no-reqsvc
* --no-request-services

Constraints and Usage Notes
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

If this option is specified, the user cannot create services within the organization.

[[JMK what can they do? currently users cannot see services they did not create let alone get tokens for them, although I think they should be able to see and get tokens for all services within their organization.]]

[[JMK test this]]

--verify
&&&&&&&&

--verify is described under :ref:`general command arguments <generalVerify>`.

.. _inviteUserEmail:

<emailAddress>
&&&&&&&&&&&&&&

Required. Indicates an email address for the invited user.

Equivalent Options
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This argument does not have a corresponding flag. It is determined by position within the command.

Constraints and Usage Notes
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The email address must be the last argument supplied with the command.

Any valid email address may be used. The string must have the format a@b.c or it will be rejected.

[[JMK test this]]

Each email address may only be used once in the system. A user may not have multiple accounts or belong to multiple organizations.

At the current time {{{company}}} does not send emails to the specified address. The output of this command should be sent to the new user so they can run the command and add themselves to your organization.
