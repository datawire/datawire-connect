About this Document
===================

Welcome to the {{{cli_product}}} Command Line Interface Guide.

Intended Audience
-----------------

Prerequisites
-------------

This documentation makes no assumptions about specific prior knowledge beyond basic familiarity with UNIX.

Conventions
-----------

The Datawire style limits formatting unless it is essential to conveying intended meaning. To that end, Datawire does not use bold or italics for emphasis or to introduce new terms nor do we format names within text in any way.

This document uses the following typographical conventions:

* ``monospace fonts`` for full commands, command syntax lines, or responses to commands
* <variable> for variables in commands, command syntax lines, or responses to commands (all other command, syntax, or response content is presented verbatim)
* ellipses (...) to indicate possible content that is not pertinent to the current discussion


[[JMK put in a table?]]

Known Issues
------------

* Two consecutive dashes may appear as a single endash within the documentation. There are no cases where an endash is intentionally used, so substitute two dashes anytime you see an endash in the document.
