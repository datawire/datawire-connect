General Command Arguments
-------------------------

The {{{cli_product}}} command line interface supports the following arguments with any command:

* -h
* --verify

These arguments are all optional but must be specified after the command and in the order listed above if used. Some commands may require command-specific arguments between the general command arguments. Refer to the documentation for each command for specifics.

.. _generalH:

-h
~~

-h provides a list of available arguments with brief descriptions for the current command.

Syntax
++++++

``{{{cli_command}}} <command> -h``

Equivalent Options
++++++++++++++++++

The following arguments are equivalent to -h:

* --help

Constraints and Usage Notes
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

If -h is specified, nothing else in the command is evaluated.

Using -h as a command level argument does not provide any specifics about the available top level arguments or available commands.

Because the {{{cli_product}}} command line interface is order dependent, the following commands are not equivalent:

``{{{cli_command}}} -h``

and

``{{{cli_command}}} <command> -h``

Further, if you specify the following:

``{{{cli_command}}} -h <command> -h``

only the first -h is evaluated; no information about <command> will be returned.

[[JMK double check this last statement]]

.. _generalVerify:

--verify
~~~~~~~~

--verify indicates that the token signatures should be verified to ensure that the supplied token was generated by {{{cli_product}}}.

[[JMK are we verifying from the state file for the user? Not entirely sure how this part works]]

Syntax
++++++

``{{{cli_command}}} <command> ... --verify ...``

Equivalent Options
++++++++++++++++++

The following arguments are equivalent to --verify:

* --verify-tokens
* --require-verification
