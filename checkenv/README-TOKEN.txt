Datawire Connect relies on service tokens created by the dwc command. Each
example uses its own service:

d3:                     animated
helloDatawireConnect:   hello
market:                 ratings

To create a service, just use

dwc create-service service-name

So, for example, to create the "hello" service you'd run

dwc create-service hello
