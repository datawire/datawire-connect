Datawire Connect relies on Python and its package manager, pip.

The recommended way to get pip is actually to install virtualenv, which
allows you to cleanly separate Python installations during development.
For more information, check out

If you don't want to use virtualenv, but you don't already have pip, you
can of course just install pip. Check out

for more about that.
