# Datawire Connect

![](static_files/dw-logo.png "Datawire")

**Datawire Connect** helps you build and run resilient microservices. It allows you to
express the interfaces between your services, define how they should behave when
they interact, and helps them reliably discover and reach other services at runtime.

A core part of Datawire Connect is **Quark**, a language that is used to define the
interfaces to your microservices and, more importantly, influence their runtime
behaviors. With Quark, you can specify much more than just the parameters of the
methods you create. You can also define how clients of that service should behave
if the service is running slowly, or add circuit breaking, or cache existing
response values to improve performance. There's no practical limit to the
sophistication of the behaviors you could add to your microservices.

Datawire Connect also includes client-side load balancing through **Baker Street**.
Client-side load balancers are far more scalable and less prone to becoming bottlenecks
than traditional centralized load balancers.

Discovery is achieved in Datawire Connect through **Datawire Hub**. This technology
offers your services a reliable and resilient way to register themselves so that
other services can find them.
