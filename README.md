Datawire Connect is a simple, powerful way to resiliently connect
microservices. Datawire Connect natively integrates into your existing
Java, Python, or NodeJS application (Ruby coming soon), and provides:

* service registration and discovery
* dynamic load balancing and routing
* automatic timeouts
* integrated circuit breakers

Moreover, Datawire Connect provides these semantics without requiring
you to modify any of your existing HTTP/REST APIs.
