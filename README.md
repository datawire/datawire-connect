# Quark

Quark lets you define and implement rich (micro)service APIs that work with your existing application frameworks and protocols. Quark lets you:

* Easily define RPC or event based APIs on top of existing REST or
  websocket protocols
* Build service APIs with rich protocol semantics
* Support multiple programming languages and application frameworks

## Getting Started

To get started, install quark:

        pip install datawire-quark

## Examples

Check out the examples in the [Quark Examples repository](https://github.com/datawire/quark/tree/master/examples):

        git clone git@github.com:datawire/quark.git
        cd quark/examples
